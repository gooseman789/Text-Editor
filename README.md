  # Description
  My motivation to make this was to learn more and practice webpack development.
  I built this to learn more specifically on Progressive Web Applications.  
  This truly does not solve many other problems besides the problem of my needing practice.
  I learned a lot about plugins and resolvers.
  
  # Installation
  I first copied the starter code.  I then worked through the TODO's listed in the starter code.
  
  # Usage
  This application should show my progress on learning this information.
  
  # Credits
  I worked on this alone but with the starter code cloned from the assignment details.
